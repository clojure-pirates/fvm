# fvm

**fvm** is an extensible stack-based self-optimizing VM.

## Example

Here's a program that calculates and prints `factorial(5)`:
```clojure
;; import the standard library
{:op :requires
 :value ["lib/std.edn"]}

;; define a new opcode for factorial
{:op :defop
 :name :fact
 :value [{:op :push
          :value 0}
         {:op :eq?
          :then [{:op :pop}
                 {:op :pop}
                 {:op :push
                  :value 1}]
          :else [{:op :pop}
                 {:op :dup}
                 {:op :dec}
                 {:op :fact}
                 {:op :mul}]}]}

;; call it
{:op :push
 :value 5}
{:op :fact}

;; print the result
{:op :println}
```

## Usage

### JVM

To run the example factorial program, do:
```shell
$ lein run test/fact.edn
```

### Native

#### Build from source

Make sure you have GraalVM installed and `$GRAALVM_HOME` pointing to it, then do:
```shell
$ ./compile
```

#### Run

Now you can do:
```shell
$ target/fvm test/fact.edn
```

## Tests

```shell
$ lein eftest
```

## Properties

1. Custom ops (like `fact` above) are inlined and called at runtime
2. No recursion limit - try running the factorial program for large values
3. Code is data is code - anonymous ops can be stored and called
4. Hot loops are traced and inlined at runtime (currently only self-tail recursion)
5. Designed to be easily parsable and an easy compilation target
6. Does not require a GC, being completely stack based
