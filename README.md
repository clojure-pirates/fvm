# fvm

**fvm** is an extensible stack-based self-optimizing VM.

## Example

Here's a program that calculates and prints `factorial(5)`:
```clojure
;; fact.edn
{:op :requires
 :value ["lib/std.edn"]}

;; define factorial
{:op :defop
 :name :fact
 :value [{:op :push
          :value 0}
         {:op :eq?
          :then [{:op :pop}
                 {:op :pop}
                 {:op :push
                  :value 1}]
          :else [{:op :pop}
                 {:op :dup}
                 {:op :dec}
                 {:op :fact}
                 {:op :mul}]}]}

;; call it
{:op :push
 :value 5}
{:op :fact}

;; print the result
{:op :println}
```

## Properties

1. Custom ops (like `fact` above) are inlined and called at runtime
2. No recursion limit - try running the factorial program for large values
3. Code is data is code - anonymous ops can be stored and called
4. Hot loops are traced and inlined at runtime
